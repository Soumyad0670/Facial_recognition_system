face_recognition
opencv-python
numpy


- You need a working webcam.

---

## Notes

- **Add more images per person** to increase recognition accuracy.
- **Folder names** are used as labels/names displayed in recognition.
- Press **`q`** in the video window to quit.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Unknown" for all faces:
- Check if your images in `known_faces` are clear and show faces frontally.
- Ensure faces are successfully encoded (see console output when running encode_faces.py).
- For hardware errors: make sure your webcam is correctly set up and accessible.

## How it works

1. **Add faces to known_faces/**  
   Create a folder for each person, and put their images inside their folder.

2. **Encode faces**  
   Run `encode_faces.py` to create `encodings.pickle` from your `known_faces` directory.


3. **Run video streaming and recognition**  
Run `video_stream.py` to start webcam-based recognition.

## Detailed Explanation

### encode_faces.py

- Loads images and their labels (folder names).
- Uses `face_recognition` to extract facial encodings.
- Stores encodings and names into `encodings.pickle` using `pickle`.

### video_stream.py

- Loads encodings from `encodings.pickle`.
- Captures frames from your webcam in real time.
- Detects and recognizes faces, labeling them with names (or "Unknown" if not found).

### utils.py

- Helper function `load_images_from_folder()` to load all images and labels from a structured directory.
